# BinDB

Author: tuonux \<tuonux0@gmail.com\>

BinDB it's a library for Grey Hack Game that allow you to create a password-protected binary database inaccessible to third parties and without need parsers or something like that.

## How to use it

At the top of everything to your code import libbindb.src with the "import_code" method.

    import_code("/absolute/path/of/libbindb.src")

After that, create a connection with your db with the following example method:

    myDb = BinDB.connect("dbname", "dbpassword", ["table1", "table2"], "/home/tuonux")

## Availables methods

### BinDB.connect(dbname, dbpassword, tablesArray, dbDirectory)

Instantiate the connection with your binary database

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb = BinDB.connect("mrRobot", "mypassword", ["users", "mails", "banks"], "/home/<user>")

### BinDB.insert(table, data)

Push the new data in your table

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Elliot", "surname": "Alderson"})
    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Tyrell", "surname": "Wellick"})
    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Angela", "surname": "Moss"})
    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Joanna", "surname": "Olofsson"})
    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Gideon", "surname": "Goddard"})

### BinDB.fetch(table)

Fetch all the rows of your table

Example Usage:

    for user in mrRobotDb.fetch("users")
         print(user.name)
    end for

### BinDB.fetchOne(table, id)

Fetch a row by the index

Example Usage:

    userElliot = mrRobotDb.fetchOne("users", 1)

### BinDB.fetchBy(table, key, value)

Fetch a row by a combination of key -> value

Example Usage:

    userElliot = mrRobotDb.fetchBy("users", "name", "Elliot")

### BinDB.update(table, id, data)

Update a row by the index

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.update("users", 1, {"name": "Mr.", "surname": "Robot"})

### BinDB.delete(table, id)

Delete a row by the index

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.delete("users", 5)

### BinDB.read()

Read binary buffer ( used in rare case )

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.read()

### BinDB.write()

Update binary database buffer

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Elliot", "surname": "Alderson"})
    mrRobotDb.write()

### BinDB.wipe()

Clear and delete the database

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.wipe()

### BinDB.printTable(table, labels)

Utility function that print your table with formatted columns

Example Usage:

    mrRobotDb.printTable("users", {"name": "Name", "surname": "Surname"})

### Methods chain

For your convenience you can chain the methods if you want

    mrRobotDb.insert("users", {"name": "Terry", "surname": "Colby"}).write()

## What if another user attempt to launch the binary database?

If someone tries to launch your database executable, an information message will be shown

    tuonux@PC:~$ /home/tuonux/mrRobot.db

    This is a binary database generated by BinDB Library
    Info: https://github.com/tuonux/gh-bindb

    tuonux@PC:~$

If someone tries to launch your database executable by passing a parameter and the password is incorrect, an error message will be shown

    tuonux@PC:~$ /home/tuonux/mrRobot.db pass
    Permission denied
    tuonux@PC:~$

## Protect the source code of your program

As long as you have your data protected in a binary database you are safe, but don't forget that as with any interpreted language, the source code of the code where you include the BinDB library could be visible to other people and they could find out your password.

Upload only the binary of your program or make sure you have the right permissions set on your file where the source code for your program resides.
